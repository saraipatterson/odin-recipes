# odin-recipes
This is my submission to the recipes project for the Odin Foundations Course. I combine all my new html, git, and command line skills, including creating and moving repositories and files via the command line; creating and managing a git repository with common git commands; writing html boilerplate; and creating linked web pages using tags, elements, links, and embedded images.
