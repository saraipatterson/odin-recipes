    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p><em>Simple 5-ingredient whole wheat bread. You just don’t get easier than this
         no-fail and no-knead recipe! Hearty, wholesome, nourishing and delicious!</em></p>
    <p>If you don’t feel like cooking, just make a loaf of this (it barely counts as ‘cooking’ 
        it’s too easy), and serve it with a huge salad, maybe some roasted garlic hummus and 
        avocado and various other toppings and dinner is done and dusted!</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 cups whole wheat flour (520 g)</li>
        <li>1 packet Instant Yeast (2 1/4 tsp)</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
        <li>2 tsp maple syrup</li>
        <li>2 cups warm water (480 ml)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Add the flour to a mixing bowl with the yeast and salt and mix together.</li>
        <li>Dissolve the maple syrup in the warm water and then add to the dry ingredients.</li>
        <li>Mix – don’t knead – until you have a sticky well combined dough.</li>
        <li>Transfer to a greased 9×5 loaf pan. You can also line the bottom with parchment paper 
            if you think there will be any chance of it sticking.</li>
        <li>Cover and leave to rise for 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>While the dough is rising, preheat the oven to 390°F (200°C).</li>
        <li>After 20 minutes when the dough has risen, bake in the oven for 40 minutes.</li>
        <li>Absolutely BEST when fresh, but will keep for a day or two in a closed container. 
            After which you can make the most delicious toast.</li>
    </ol>
